This is the final project of the first course in Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

The goal is to construct a Portfolio Website using HTML and CSS, following a mockup guide provided [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a136147_design-mockup-portfolio/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf).

To do so, I utilized WC3 bootsrap.min CSS styles as well as my own style sheet.

The site includes features that will later be enabled and completed, such as the NAV bar link and further details populating the different tabs.
